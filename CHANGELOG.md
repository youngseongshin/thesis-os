# Changelog

## 0.6.1 - 2026-05-31

- Reposition README hero around the accountability layer: "Stop building persuasive AI. Build accountable AI."
- Add a prediction-ledger demo GIF that shows register -> wait -> grade.
- Add a public-safe prediction ledger accountability sample that shows hits and misses together.
- Add promotion and compliance guardrails, including disclaimer language and public/private promotion boundaries.
- Expand the public launch plan around P0/P1/P2/P3 sequencing, developer audience, VC/finance audience, and legal-review gates.
- Add `judgment-os`, `prediction-ledger`, `auditable-ai`, `evidence-first`, and `accountability-layer` keywords.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-05-29

- Separate process quality from market outcome: add `process_score`, `result_score`, and `outcome_confidence` to screener and judgment feedback so a sound process is not graded by noisy short-term results.
- Add `thesis_type`, `native_horizon`, and `measurement_note` to theses, plus direction-aware result scoring, so a multi-year compounder thesis is not invalidated by a short timing-window return. New doc: thesis types and native horizons.
- Add a process-quality module (`thesis_os/lattice/process_quality.py`) and extend the demo, schemas, and tests around the process/result split.
- Add `thesis-os quickstart-stock`: a no-credential public stock loop using a bundled sample CSV by default, with an optional `--live` no-key Yahoo/Stooq mode.
- Add rolling walk-forward screener feedback to the quickstart (rolling windows, hit rate, average excess return, per-window candidate table), framed explicitly as a loop demonstration rather than an alpha claim.
- Add live research channel links.
- Upgrade CI actions to the Node 24 runtime (`actions/checkout@v6`, `actions/setup-python@v6`) to clear the Node 20 deprecation warnings.
- Add a redaction gate: a secret/PII scan and public-sanitization test, with an installable pre-push hook.
- Restructure the English and Korean READMEs to lead with the value proposition, a copy-paste quickstart, and the dashboard screenshot; replace SEO keyword lists with natural copy (repo topics already cover discovery) and add Python/PRs badges.
- Replace the architecture diagram, refine the launch README flow, and sharpen the public value proposition and discoverability.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-05-28

- Add a Thesis OS coverage review that tracks implemented, partial, and intentionally excluded public components.
- Add a CSV-backed trade/customs proxy evidence layer for semiconductor, memory, HBM, substrate, and supply-chain thesis inputs.
- Add `thesis-os alpha trade-proxy` to write trade proxy evidence into the local DB and vault.
- Add harness contract schema, sample manifest, and `thesis-os arki validate-harness` for recurring-job ownership, inputs, outputs, delivery, and failure-policy checks.
- Add `thesis-os arki build-dashboard` for a static HTML cockpit covering theses, watchlists, actions, predictions, and performance feedback.
- Add dashboard cockpit and Thesis OS coverage docs.
- Refine English and Korean READMEs to communicate the project value, differentiation, runnable components, and dashboard workflow more clearly.
- Extend the demo and tests so trade proxy evidence and harness validation produce executable vault outputs.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-05-28

- Add a public-safe sample output pack covering thesis cards, nightly Top 5 deep dives, concentrated strategy reviews, screener discovery, screener feedback, and social collection.
- Link sample outputs from English and Korean READMEs.
- Add a sample-output boundary doc and test coverage for public-sanitized metadata.
- Strengthen the README and philosophy docs around the default investment lens: Munger for discovery, O'Neil/Minervini for timing, and Druckenmiller for asymmetric concentration.
- Add public-safe agent persona contracts and prompt-boundary guidance for Alpha, Lattice, and Arki.
- Expand recurring job documentation and link the public-safe job manifest from the README.
- Add memory management documentation and a sample memory policy covering capture, promotion, retrieval, retention, and feedback memory.
- Add vault governance documentation and a sample vault policy for document routing, codeowners, canonical paths, validators, and cleanup.
- Add skill and pipeline documentation for social/Facebook/YouTube collection, real-time market monitoring, deep dives, semiconductor specialist analysis, Deep Alpha, devil's advocate, and feedback workflows.
