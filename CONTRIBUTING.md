## Development Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
python -m thesis_os lint --root .
python -m thesis_os demo --out /tmp/thesis-os-demo
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Design Standard

New features should answer:

1. Which agent owns this?
2. What object does it create or update?
3. What evidence does it require?
4. What is the public/private data boundary?
5. How can the output be checked later?
