# Why Thesis OS Is Not Another Stock Picker

Most AI investing tools try to answer one question:

> What should I buy?

Thesis OS starts with a different question:

> Why did I believe this idea, what would prove me wrong, and did the judgment actually work after time passed?

That difference matters. A recommendation can be persuasive and still be useless six weeks later. A thesis-driven system has to leave a trail: evidence, assumptions, action, prediction, invalidation, and feedback.

## The Problem

Investment research tends to fragment:

- charts in one tool
- filings in another
- notes in a vault
- ideas in chat
- watchlists in a spreadsheet
- decisions in memory
- outcomes rarely reviewed with discipline

The result is not a lack of information. It is a lack of judgment structure.

## The Thesis OS Loop

Thesis OS turns research into an auditable loop:

```text
collect evidence
-> run quantitative screeners
-> create candidates
-> build thesis cards
-> record actions and predictions
-> evaluate forward returns
-> update the process
```

The first public quickstart uses bundled sample stock data so the loop works even when public endpoints rate-limit a shared IP:

```bash
thesis-os quickstart-stock --out ./quickstart_run
```

It is not a trading signal. It is a working example of how a stock screener becomes accountable.

## Why Public Data Is Enough To Start

There are already many excellent public quantitative databases and analysis libraries: Stooq, FinanceDataReader, OpenBB, pykrx, SEC EDGAR, edgartools, DART/OpenDART, FRED, public customs APIs, and more.

Thesis OS does not try to replace those sources. It gives them a judgment workflow:

```text
public or private data -> evidence -> screener -> thesis -> prediction -> feedback
```

Start with public data. Replace it later with better licensed sources, broker exports, private notes, or paid feeds if your use case requires them.

## Three Roles

Thesis OS uses a simple three-agent operating model:

- **Alpha** collects and verifies evidence.
- **Lattice** makes investment judgments, in the spirit of Charlie Munger's latticework of mental models.
- **Arki** keeps schemas, vault structure, recurring jobs, and system health under control.

The goal is not to make a chatbot sound confident. The goal is to separate collection, judgment, and governance so the system can be reviewed.

## What The Project Gives Builders

Thesis OS is useful if you want to build your own research system and need:

- a thesis/evidence/action/prediction/feedback object model
- a CSV-backed quantitative screener
- a guaranteed sample stock quickstart with optional no-key live public data
- markdown vault notes
- SQLite local storage
- a prediction ledger
- screener feedback reports
- a static dashboard cockpit
- job and skill contracts for recurring automation

It is early and intentionally public-safe. It does not include private portfolio data, broker sessions, paid raw feeds, or private chat logs.

## The Principle

The project is not trying to be an autonomous alpha machine.

It is trying to make investment judgment explicit enough to improve.

If a thesis was wrong, the system should be able to say why:

- the data was bad
- the interpretation was wrong
- the timing was extended
- the idea was already priced in
- the business evidence never supported the price signal

That is the compounding asset: not one stock pick, but a judgment loop that can be audited and refined.
