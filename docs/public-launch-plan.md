# Public Launch Plan

The first public goal is not to claim investment performance. It is to show a coherent, runnable framework for accountable thesis-driven research.

## Core Campaign Message

```text
Stop building persuasive AI. Build accountable AI.
```

Thesis OS should be positioned as an **accountability layer for investment agents**. Competing thinking-skill projects sell better reasoning inside a single response. Thesis OS sells the next layer: a prediction is registered before the outcome, preserved in a ledger, and graded later.

## Positioning

Thesis OS is:

- a thesis-driven investment research framework
- an agent operating model
- an evidence and feedback loop
- a local-first research memory system
- a prediction-ledger and accountability layer for investment agents

Thesis OS is not:

- an autonomous trading bot
- a stock picker
- a signal seller
- financial advice

## What Makes It Interesting

1. It treats investment theses as structured, living objects.
2. It separates Alpha evidence collection from Lattice judgment.
3. It makes predictions explicit before outcomes.
4. It closes the loop with feedback and failure modes.
5. It defines a hard boundary between public methods and private data.
6. It separates process quality from result quality, reducing hindsight and cherry-picking.

## P0: Landing Surface

- README hero leads with accountability, prediction ledger, and no-key quickstart.
- `prediction-ledger-demo.gif` demonstrates register -> wait -> grade.
- Public-safe sample output shows hits and misses together.
- Compliance disclaimer is linked from README and docs.
- CHANGELOG and ROADMAP match the current release.
- GitHub topics include both existing search terms and category-creation terms:
  - `investment`
  - `stock-screener`
  - `ai-agents`
  - `judgment-os`
  - `prediction-ledger`
  - `auditable-ai`
  - `evidence-first`
  - `investment-research`

## P1: Developer / AI-Agent Audience

Primary post angle:

> Thesis OS — an investment agent framework that grades its own predictions.

Safe channels:

- Show HN
- r/algotrading
- r/LocalLLaMA
- r/quant
- X/Twitter developer thread
- AI-agent and mental-model awesome lists

Rule: discuss framework mechanics only. Do not mention live stock calls, target prices, or selective performance examples.

## P2: VC / Finance Professional Audience

Position as:

- IC memo stress-test layer
- investment judgment audit trail
- thesis card and devil's advocate workflow
- local-first institutional memory

Useful article angle:

> Why investment committees should make their judgments machine-readable before the outcome is known.

## P3: Live Research Linkage

Do not launch this phase before legal and internal-compliance review.

Allowed framing after review:

- process evidence
- public-safe examples
- balanced hit/miss ledger

Avoid:

- cherry-picked profitable calls
- live trade guidance
- paid interactive recommendations
- target-price promotion

## Launch Checklist

- README explains the accountability loop in under one minute.
- A guaranteed sample stock quickstart runs without broker credentials, paid feeds, or network access; optional `--live` mode demonstrates no-key public data.
- Public data sources are positioned as pluggable inputs, not bundled proprietary datasets.
- Prediction ledger and screener feedback are visible as the core accountability mechanisms.
- Public-safe sample outputs show both hits and misses.
- Compliance disclaimer is linked.
- CI passes.
- Contributor docs exist.
- Security boundary is explicit.
- Screenshots and diagrams exist.
- Issues are prefilled with agent ownership and object ownership.

## Launch Copy Rule

Avoid claiming that the public repository is a finished alpha machine. The public message should be:

> Thesis OS is a runnable framework for building a thesis-driven stock research and trading-journal loop. It helps users plug in public or private data, create thesis cards, register predictions, and evaluate whether their screeners and judgments worked.

The repo should lead with the no-key quickstart, then explain the philosophy. Philosophy matters more after the user has seen something run.

## Compliance Copy Rule

Use this sentence when promoting beyond GitHub:

> Thesis OS is an open-source framework for investment research workflows. It is not investment advice, a stock recommendation service, a signal seller, or an autonomous trading system.
